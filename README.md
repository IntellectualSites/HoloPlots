# HoloPlots
This is an official PlotSquared addon which creates holograms by the sign location for plots and, if configured, a player head above it. If you only want to have Holograms, you will need to disable signs in the PlotSquared configuration.

## Installation

This addon requires PlotSquared, HolograhpicDisplays and ProtocolLib. You can get them below:

- [PlotSquared](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/77506/)
- [HolographicDisplays](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/holographic-displays/files)
- [ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/)

## Configuration

Change the sign text in the PlotSquared translation file to modify the created Holograms.
