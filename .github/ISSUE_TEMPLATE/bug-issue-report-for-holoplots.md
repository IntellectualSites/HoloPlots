<!--- # NOTICE: 
```diff
! PlotSquared for Minecraft Java Edition versions between 1.7 through to 1.12.2 are considered
! legacy, and will receive limited to no support. Please consider upgrading to 1.13+ for
! future support.  Plugins exist for 1.13+ which bring back behaviors found in 1.8.8
! All versions of PlotSquared for Sponge and Nukkit(X) will recieve limited to no support
! due to lack of developer interest and time. Additionally, NukkitX has not had feature
! updates since the Better Together, which prevents some PlotSquared features from ever
! functioning.  Contributions are always welcome however!
